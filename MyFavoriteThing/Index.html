    <p>In EPS, there are 4 class periods per day, each of them are 70 minutes but one of them is a free period so you
        have a lot of freedom which I like. Also, the teachers are really nice and helpfull which makes classes a lot
        more interesting and enjoyable. However, my favorite aspect of EPS is probably being able to see and talk to my
        friends.</p>
