            <P>We use a unique curriculum which is tailored specifically for each and every student. Based on their
                learning style, we write songs to match their individual musical interest. We make our lessons fun and
                enjoyable for our students by incorporating ear training, composition, and teaching pieces they enjoy
                such as songs from the radio and movie soundtracks. Our goal is to make our students develop a
                life-lasting array of skills and passion for music, rather than just another dropped hobby.</P>

            <p>From 2015, our students have been dominating all competitions entered, especially the National PTA
                Reflections competition. In the 2018-2019 school year, there were over 18,000 students entered in
                Washington State, 23 of them consisting of our students. A total of 9 students were awarded at the state
                level, 6 of them being from our initial 23 students. We won 66% of the state winners, when our students
                only attributed 0.13% of the total entrees! Our students are ranked 1st in Washington and 2nd nationally
                in composition!</p>
